# Desertification Simulation

This project simulates the spread of desertification using a hexagonal grid-based model based on Cellular Automata (CA). The application is designed to visualize and analyze the dynamics of desertification processes, offering insights into how environmental factors influence degradation over time.

## Features
- **Hexagonal Grid Simulation**: Realistic interactions between neighboring cells based on environmental parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Configure simulation parameters such as grid size, step intervals, and speed.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch desertification spread dynamically with color-coded grids and adjustable settings.
- **Data Import/Export**: Load initial conditions from CSV files and save simulation results for further analysis.
- **Experimental Data Generation**: Create own number of clusters to test unusual cases.

## Getting Started
